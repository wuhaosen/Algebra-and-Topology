$\epsilon$ estimate on $(x,y,-)$ is bounded, for $\epsilon$ estimate on $(-,-,t)$, on back. 

We take dividends on $p$ points in $\R$

Thoughts on 4:
    \[
    \xymatrix{
    \Z \ar[r]^{}\ar[dr]^{i_1} & \langle a,b; a^2=b^2 \rangle \ar[d]^{\varphi}&  \Z \ar[l]_{} \ar[dl]_{i_2}\\
    & \Z/2 \subset S_3 &
    }
    \]
    
    In the same vein we map $i_1(1\in \Z)=1\in \Z/3$ and second $i_2(1\in \Z)=2\in \Z/3$, which is the only plausible map. Computation shows that such generated $\varphi$ will send first $\varphi(1\in \Z)=1 \in \Z/3$, second $\varphi(1\in \Z)=2 \in \Z/3$, but then first $\varphi((1\in \Z)^2)=2 \in \Z/3$ and second $\varphi((1\in \Z)^2)=(2 \in \Z/3)^2=1 \in \Z/3$. This contradicts with well-defindness of $\varphi$ and relation $a^2=b^2$, therefore, there is no correspond covering.
    
    When fixing F, we talk about: $|Image|=1$, we have the trivial bundle (with Klein-bottle structure) covering; this is also the case that fibre elements get fixed since it is identity permutation, and we also know within the isomorphism class we could have $3!$ many coverings (as well in 2).
